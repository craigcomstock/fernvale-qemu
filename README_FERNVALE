to build

./configure --disable-werror --enable-debug --target-list=arm-softmmu
make

to run, do the following in order in separate terminals
NOTE: I haven't gotten this to work yet, probably due to fernvale-qemu currently wanting an FPGA ROM emulation component (I think?)

in fernly:
./build/fernly-usb-loader -w /dev/ttyUSB0 ./build/usb-loader.bin ./build/firmware.bin

and here:
./run.sh
